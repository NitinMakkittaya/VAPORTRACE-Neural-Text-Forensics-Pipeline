# 🔍 VAPORTRACE // Advanced Document Forensics & Semantic Reasoning Engine

> **VAPORTRACE** is an AI-powered document forensics platform that detects semantic manipulation, entity tampering, and structural inconsistencies between a trusted baseline document and a questioned version. By combining Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and interactive graph visualization, it provides an explainable forensic analysis instead of simple text comparison.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional document comparison tools focus primarily on exact text differences. However, malicious edits often involve subtle wording changes, entity replacements, or contextual manipulation that preserve grammar while altering meaning.

**VAPORTRACE** addresses this challenge by analyzing documents at a semantic level. It measures contextual similarity using sentence embeddings, tracks Named Entity changes, and generates an explainable forensic report with an interactive relationship graph.

The platform is designed for educational research, AI experimentation, cybersecurity demonstrations, and document integrity analysis.

# ✨ Features

### 🧠 Semantic Drift Detection

Uses transformer-based sentence embeddings to measure contextual similarity between corresponding paragraphs instead of relying solely on keyword matching.

- Detects rewritten content
- Identifies paraphrased manipulation
- Computes semantic similarity scores
- Highlights meaning changes despite identical vocabulary

---

### 🏷️ Entity Tampering Detection

Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies critical entities and compares them between documents.

Supported entities include:

- 👤 Persons
- 🏢 Organizations
- 📍 Locations
- 📅 Dates
- 💰 Money
- 🌐 Geopolitical Entities
- 📦 Products

The engine automatically flags:

- Entity insertion
- Entity removal
- Entity replacement
- Suspicious substitutions

---

### 📄 Intelligent Document Parsing

Documents are parsed while preserving logical structure.

Supports:

- Raw text
- PDF documents
- Byte streams

Powered by **PyMuPDF**, ensuring accurate extraction before analysis.

---

### 🤖 AI Reasoning Engine

Rather than presenting raw similarity scores, the reasoning module interprets findings and produces automated forensic observations.

Example:

> Paragraph 5 exhibits significant semantic drift (Similarity: 41%). The organization entity has changed from **OpenAI** to **Open Data Institute**, suggesting possible contextual manipulation.

---

### 🌐 Interactive Network Visualization

Every analysis is represented as a directed graph.

The graph visualizes:

- Document hierarchy
- Paragraph relationships
- Semantic links
- Entity modifications
- Suspicious nodes
- Confidence levels

Built using **Vis.js** for an interactive forensic experience.
